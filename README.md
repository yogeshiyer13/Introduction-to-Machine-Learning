**Part 1 - Data Preprocessing -** 
Data preprocessing has the following parts: 
- Importing the libraries - Basic libraries which would be useful while processing the data such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib
- Importing the dataset- How to get data from .csv file
- Taking care of missing data - How to deal when some filed in the column is missing
- Encoding categorical data - Most machine learning algorithms require numerical input and output variables 
hence one hot encoding is used to convert categorical data to integer data.
- Splitting the data into training and test set
- Feature Scaling: It is a step of Data Pre Processing which is applied to independent variables or features of data. 
It basically helps to normalise the data within a particular range

**Part 2 - Simple Linear Regression -**
Simple linear regression is a linear regression model with a single explanatory variable. That is, it concerns two-dimensional sample points with one independent variable and one dependent variable (conventionally, the x and y coordinates in a Cartesian coordinate system) and finds a linear function (a non-vertical straight line) that, as accurately as possible, predicts the dependent variable values as a function of the independent variables.  
The simple linear regression model is represented by:

- Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set

- Visualising the Training set results
- Visualising the Test set results

**Part 3 - Multiple Linear Regression -**
Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. The goal of multiple linear regression (MLR) is to model the linear relationship between the explanatory (independent) variables & response (dependent) variable.

**Part 4 - Polynomial Regression -**
In the last section, we saw two variables in our data set were correlated but what happens if we know that our data is correlated, but the relationship doesnâ€™t look linear? So hence depending on what the data looks like, we can do a polynomial regression on the data to fit a polynomial equation to it.
