# Introduction-to-Machine-Learning
**Part 1 - Data Preprocessing -** 
Data preprocessing has the following parts: 
- Importing the libraries - Basic libraries which would be useful while processing the data such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib
- Importing the dataset- How to get data from .csv file
- Taking care of missing data - How to deal when some filed in the column is missing
- Encoding categorical data - Most machine learning algorithms require numerical input and output variables 
hence one hot encoding is used to convert categorical data to integer data.
- Splitting the data into training and test set
- Feature Scaling: It is a step of Data Pre Processing which is applied to independent variables or features of data. 
It basically helps to normalise the data within a particular range
